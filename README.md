# Making something in python
List of small programs that i decided to make in spare times. This small programs are not something that <ins>**revolutionary**</ins>, but it is something... i guess?

**Why in python ?** i don't want to deal with types or f****ing memory allocation, i just want to make silly things as fast as possible. And i pretty sick using js.

So here are things i made :
## 1. bruteForcePrintStyle.py
**Description** : Printing is so basic, so why not print in brute force style -ish (lol)

**Output** (Here what happens if the input is "abc") :  
```
a
aa
ab
aba
abb
abc
```
